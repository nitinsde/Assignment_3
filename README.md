# Assignment_3
## Task 1: Finding factorial of an integer.
         -> Here i have defined a function to find factorial.
         -> My program takes a number as an argument and calculates it using defined function.
         -> If someone call function argument as a input it print the output directly.

## Task 2: Some calculations using math module.
        -> The program ask the user for a number as input.
        -> Uses math module to find:
               1. Square root of that number.
               2. Natural logarithm (log base 'e' ) of that number.
               3. Sine of that number(note: Here number is asumed to be in radians)
        -> Finally print all  calculated result as output.
